## Inline Table 

This means that you surround the "Your Write" section with one set of dollar signs.

| You Write | It Renders |
|:---------:|:----------:|
| v         | $v$        |
| v_{out}   | $v_{out}$  |
| x^2       | $x^2$      |
| A \cup B  | $A \cup B$ |
| C \cap D  | $C \cap D$ |
| e \in E                               | $e \in E$                               |
| \frac{1}{2}                           | $\frac{1}{2}$                           |
| \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} | $\frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ |

## Sectioned Table

This is for things that you surround with two dollar signs on ea. side, and can only be done in separated blocks.  It is assumed that you can do anything you can inline in here as well.
