Today, I was looking at doing some reading in the [Refactoring book][refactoring], but looking to take some notes from my reading.
I remembered that there was this cool site where a guy had made graph theory notes that looked really good, so I thought
I'd go back to take a look at getting something similar for myself.

It took a lot of looking around. I wasn't sure if it'd be in my Evernote, my browser bookmarks, or in some other kind of
note-taking system. It turns out, it was actually in github. I remembered that that was the case after wracking my brain,
and coming up with the fact that it had looked like a github.io page. Searching there, it wasn't actully that hard to
find the [greuler project site][greuler]. This led me to the [original notes][notes] that I'd seen.

I'd gotten pretty lucky that the original theme seemed to match up correctly with what was being presented. I did see that
the latex support wasn't standard, however. After doing some looking, I was able to find that it was done w/a
[MathJax plugin][mathjax]. Luckily, there was a nice linked [MathJax guide][mathjax-guide] that I could follow. I also
switched to using [redcarpet][redcarpet], adding in some extension settings I found in [this page][redcarpet-ext] to 
switch over to Github Flavored Markup to better support tables, which aren't in the regular markdown support.

Once I got that all setup, I moved over to exploring Latex stuff, documenting what I found in a little exploration
in [this post]({% post_url 2015-12-25-math-markup-guide %}).
